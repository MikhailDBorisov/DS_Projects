### Описание Проекта
Computer randomly chooses a number from 0 to 100. Then, computer randomly guesses this number returning how many attempts on average are required to guess it right.

### Considered Use Case
The task is to write a program that will guess a random number from 0 to 100 in less than 20 attempts.

### Data Description
Array of 1000 random numbers from 0 to 100.

### Project Stages
**Stages:**
- Write a program that guesses a single random number
- Run this program on an array of 1000 random numbers
- Obtain mean number of attempts to guess a number

### Results
Algorithm guesses a number on average in 7 attempts.

### Conclusion
Project completed successfully since the mean number of attempts for the written program does not exceed 20.
